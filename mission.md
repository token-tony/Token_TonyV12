# Token Tony Universe ‚Äî Mission & Operating Guide

Token Tony is the blue‚Äëcollar alpha dad of Solana: the grounded protector who hunts fresh plays, warns against rugs, and delivers punchy, data‚Äëbacked reports. Token the Owl is Tony‚Äôs sharp‚Äëeyed sidekick ‚Äî the scout with vision who spots danger and opportunity early. Together they‚Äôre a duo: protector + hype, signal + style.

## Mission
- Hunt fresh SOL tokens fast and reliably.
- Protect against rugs with real risk signals.
- Scout moonshots before they break out.
- Blend trust, memes, and alpha into a shareable brand.

## System Overview
- Pot System: a living ‚Äústew‚Äù of 300‚Äì500 active tokens ‚Äî always full, never clogged. Losers get discarded to keep flow healthy.
- Buckets (dynamic, rotating):
  - Hatching: newborn (minutes old), limited intel, neutral quips.
  - Fresh: young (‚â§24h), compact reports with scores.
  - Cooking: momentum heating up (volume/price spikes, route sanity).
  - Top (Top Shelf): Tony‚Äôs best picks now, highest confidence and score.
  - Scrap Heap: rugs/dead/low‚Äëscore leftovers.
- Rotation: coins move buckets as they age or heat up; discards are pruned quickly.

## Re‚Äëanalysis Cadence (current defaults)
- Hatching: every 2 minutes (`HATCHING_REANALYZE_MINUTES=2`).
- Fresh: every ~12 minutes (`FRESH_REANALYZE_MINUTES=12`).
- Cooking: every 5 minutes (`COOKING_REANALYZE_MINUTES=5`).
- Others: every ~45 minutes (`OTHER_REANALYZE_MINUTES=45`).
- Discards/maintenance: periodic retention pruning and WAL checkpoint.

## Scoring Model
- SSS ‚Äî Safety Score: mint/freeze authorities, top holders concentration, RugCheck, creator history.
- MMS ‚Äî Momentum/Maturity Score: liquidity, volume, market cap, age, socials, price action.
- Final Score: age‚Äëweighted blend with confidence drag for incomplete data.
  - Young (<7 days): roughly balanced SSS/MMS.
  - Mid (‚â§30 days): MMS weighted.
  - Older: MMS strongly weighted.
- Grades (report tone and icons):
  - Moonshot (‚â•85) ‚Äî üöÄ
  - Promising (‚â•65) ‚Äî üìà/üî•
  - Risky (‚â•40) ‚Äî ‚ö†Ô∏è
  - Danger (<40) ‚Äî üíÄ / ü™§

## Commands (current script)
- `/start`: quick intro and menu.
- `/fresh`: compact list from the Fresh bucket with current scores and quips.
- `/hatching`: newborns (minutes old) with neutral tone and limited data.
- `/cooking`: heated momentum plays (volume/price spike logic with fallbacks).
- `/top`: ‚ÄúTop Shelf‚Äù picks ‚Äî highest scoring and filtered for quality.
- `/check <mint>`: deep dive on a specific mint (intel + market snapshot + chart image when available).
- `/diag`: system diagnostics (providers, queues, buckets, scheduling, env hints).
- Owner/admin only: `/setpublic`, `/setvip` (schedule auto‚Äëpushes), `/dbclean`, `/dbprune`, `/dbpurge confirm`, `/logclean`.
- Cooldowns: per‚Äëcoin/list cooldowns to ensure healthy rotation (`COMMAND_COOLDOWN_HOURS=12`).

## Operating Sources & Flow
Discovery (cheap, real‚Äëtime)
- PumpPortal WebSocket: new token/migration events.
- Logs Firehose over WebSocket (Helius; optional Alchemy/Syndica URLs): subscribe to key Raydium program logs to catch pool births.

Enrichment (tiered, cached)
- DexScreener: primary live market data and charts.
- BirdEye: market/holders snapshot; used when fast and available.
- GeckoTerminal: fallback market data when DexScreener lacks coverage.
- Helius: asset metadata, mints, creator wallet traces, top holders via RPC.
- RugCheck: risk labeling and score cues.
- Jupiter: route sanity to avoid untradable/walled tokens.

Caching & Efficiency
- Stale snapshot tolerance: `SNAPSHOT_STALENESS_SECONDS=1200` with just‚Äëin‚Äëtime refresh before sending.
- Tiered fallbacks minimize network cost and surface useful intel even when partial.
- Batching and adaptive concurrency (`ADAPTIVE_BATCH_SIZE`, `INITIAL_ANALYSIS_CONCURRENCY`) keep latency stable.

## Maintenance & Reliability
- Auto‚Äëmaintenance worker: prunes snapshots and rejected rows by retention, drops stale ‚Äúdiscovered‚Äù items, checkpoints WAL, and VACUUMs periodically.
- On‚Äëdemand admin: `/dbclean`, `/dbprune`, `/dbpurge confirm`, `/logclean`.
- Weekly housekeeping: WAL checkpoint, VACUUM, log rotation cleanup.

## Brand Voice & Quips
- Tone: conversational, confident, witty; alpha hunter meets protective dad.
- Reports: short, scannable, data‚Äëfirst; emojis as visual cues.
- Samples:
  - ‚ÄúTony smells alpha ‚Äî and it‚Äôs not just his cologne.‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not early ‚Äî you‚Äôre the exit liquidity.‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúChart talkin‚Äô. Tony listenin‚Äô.‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúData > drama. Always.‚Äù
